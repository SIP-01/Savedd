/**
 * Query-coverage re-ranking for merged search results.
 *
 * Every provider scores its own results (source priority bands + engine
 * position), but external engines rank by THEIR order — never by how many
 * of the query's words a result actually contains. This pass reweights the
 * merged list so word coverage drives the order, exactly as users expect:
 *
 *   "walk in the park"
 *     1. exact phrase / all 4 words present  → top
 *     2. 3 of 4 words                        → lower
 *     3. 2 of 4                              → lower still
 *     4. 1 of 4                              → near the bottom
 *     5. none (engine returned it loosely)   → sinks hard but stays
 *
 * Mechanics: score' = base × (0.55 + 0.45 × coverage), where coverage is
 * 50% title + 50% body (snippet + domain + tags + full event content for
 * Nostr-backed results — "if 4 words are in an article, it lists high").
 * The spread far exceeds the merge's ±5 recency tie-band, so coverage wins.
 * Keyword stakes are exempt: their placement is the exact-match contract
 * (a stake on "monero wallet" tops "monero wallet" by design).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT model-based: an AI rerank adds seconds of latency per
 * search and leaks the full result set to a third party. This is instant,
 * offline-capable, and private — and it's exactly the ranking rule asked for.
